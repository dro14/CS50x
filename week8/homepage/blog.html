                    <p class="mb-30">Who am I? I think it is the most important question one may ask oneself. Well, I am an ordinary boy who came from a peripheral part of the country and studied at a local public school but was lucky enough to get into the best university in the country. During my school years, I could not have imagined that I would have such opportunities. However, as it turns out, life is full of serendipities.</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">My grandparents from the father’s side were medical practitioners, and my uncle is a renowned surgeon, so it is not unusual that medicine drew me as well. Yet, it was not a conscious and well-thought choice. In my final school year, one of our relatives told my mom that a new university was getting established with a faculty of medicine with English as the language of education, the first medical one in the country. Meanwhile, I was preparing for a local medical institute but not for an English one. Then, I decided to risk my entire graduating year in preparation for AKFA University. Why risky? Because the university was international and newly equipped, it was expensive, too. My family could not afford to educate me by paying such high tuition fees. Fortunately, after exams, when the results were published, I was the happiest applicant to look at them: I was ranked first and got admitted on a full scholarship, which was a real blessing. To my surprise, as I was finishing my first year as a med student, I felt that something was not clicking, something was not in its place, and gradually I realized that medicine was not my field. But, at the same time, I did not know what to do next.</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">During that summer, a brand new campus of AKFA University was constructed while I was considering what specialty to choose. Along with the new campus, new faculties appeared. Among them, there was one that really stroke me: Computer Science. Although I prepared for medicine, I grew up with a desktop we had at home. I used to tinker with its inner parts, installing and removing various programs. I guess I spent more time with that desktop than with my classmates. Despite objections from everyone I know and the fact that I was losing a whole year of studying medicine, this interest, in the end, led me to transfer from the Medical School to the Computer Science Department of AKFA University. Now, I am having a great time here and am satisfied with what I am learning here.</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">For now, almost a year past since I wrote my first program in C++: “Hello World!”. Since it was my first programming language, I have written many small programs in C++. Later, I encountered another language called Python, which, I should admit, is with more intuitive syntax. After it, I got familiar with Swift, SQL, and JavaScript and learned how the Internet works. I do not have job experience yet; however, what I can say is that I am a curious and quick learner. I enjoy gaining a deep understanding of how things work. Therefore I am more fond of writing code that deals with the “guts” of a computer than changing the color of buttons and resizing text boxes for a user interface. According to the internship description, there will be experience with data collection, its manipulation, and system security. It appears this will fit very well with my aspirations.</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">To quote Elon Musk:</p>
                    <blockquote>I think it is possible for ordinary people to choose to be extraordinary.</blockquote>
                    <p class="mb-30">AKFA University provided me, an ordinary boy from a province, with an opportunity to go to the country level. Likewise, I hope this internship at the US Embassy is the beginning of my journey of rising to the global level. I expect it will increase my realization of how diverse the world is and how intertwined computers and the Internet are in our lives. Finally, I look forward to being, once more, convinced that life is full of serendipities.</p>
